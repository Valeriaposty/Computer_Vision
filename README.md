# Car Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time car detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. The script captures video from a webcam, processes each frame, and detects cars using a pre-trained classifier.

## Features
- Real-time video capture from the webcam.
- Car detection using Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Visual feedback with bounding boxes drawn around detected cars.
